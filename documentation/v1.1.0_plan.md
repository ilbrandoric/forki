# Forkcraft v1.1.0 — Core Gameplay Loop Expansion Plan

## Overview

Version **v1.1.0** expands Forkcraft from a mechanics MVP into a **repeatable, scalable gameplay loop**.

The goal is to turn the game into a system where the player:
- repeatedly delivers cargo,
- navigates increasing chaos,
- chooses between risk and reward,
- and prepares the project for real art and audio.

This version focuses on **systems**, not polish-heavy content.

## Product North Star

> The player repeatedly pushes boxes to destinations to earn money, while navigating an increasingly chaotic warehouse full of moving obstacles and optional rewards.

All features in v1.1.0 must serve this loop.

---

## Development Rules (Critical)

- All work happens on a new branch: `feature/core-loop`
- One system per iteration (no mixing)
- Each iteration must:
  - have its own task file
  - be validated before moving on
  - be shippable in isolation
- Copilot must follow the explain → review → approve → generate workflow
- No refactors unless explicitly allowed
- No art or sound assets until the system is ready

---

## Iteration Roadmap

### Iteration 09 — Pushable Cargo System

**Goal:**  
The forklift can push a cargo box like in Sokoban-style games.

**Scope:**
- Player can push the box
- Box moves only when touched
- Box cannot be pulled
- Box respects walls / boundaries
- No new boxes yet
- No scoring yet
- No targets yet

**System type:** physics / interaction

---

### Iteration 10 — Repeating Delivery Loop

**Goal:**  
Create an infinite delivery loop.

**Scope:**
- When box reaches target → money++
- Box is removed
- New box spawns at random position
- New target spawns at random position
- Each successful delivery slightly increases obstacle speed
- Loop repeats indefinitely

**System type:** core game loop

---

### Iteration 11 — Obstacle System v2

**Goal:**  
Introduce controlled chaos.

**Scope:**
- Static obstacles (cones, barriers)
- Moving obstacles (people, animals)
- Multiple obstacle types
- Reuse existing movement logic
- No new collision rules
- No damage system

**System type:** environment hazards

---

### Iteration 12 — Reward Collectibles System

**Goal:**  
Add optional risk/reward decisions.

**Scope:**
- Spawn collectible items (coffee, donuts, gold bars)
- Player collects items by touching them
- Counters update in HUD
- No power-ups yet
- No temporary effects yet

**System type:** reward economy

---

### Iteration 13 — Audio System

**Goal:**  
Add basic music control.

**Scope:**
- Background music loop
- Toggle music on/off
- Persist preference during session
- No sound effects yet
- No volume mixing yet

**System type:** audio control

---

### Iteration 14 — Art Readiness & Visual Pipeline

**Goal:**  
Prepare the project for real art assets without changing gameplay.

**Scope:**
- CSS variables for colors
- Asset folders structure
- Class names for sprites
- Background layers
- No gameplay changes
- No final art yet

**System type:** visual pipeline preparation

---

## Version Exit Criteria (v1.1.0)

Forkcraft v1.1.0 is complete when:

- The delivery loop is infinite
- Difficulty increases naturally
- Rewards create optional risk
- Obstacles feel alive
- Audio can be controlled
- The project is ready for real art
- All systems are modular and documented
- No iteration broke previous ones

---

## Notes for Copilot Usage

- Each iteration gets its own `.github/tasks/XX-*.md`
- Copilot must never work across iterations
- All explanations are reviewed before code generation
- All iterations are locked once validated
- Restart strategy remains simple and safe
