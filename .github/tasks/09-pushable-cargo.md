# Iteration 09 — Pushable Cargo System

## Goal

Add a **single pushable box** that the player can push by walking into it.

At the end of this iteration:
- Player can push the box forward
- Player cannot pull the box
- Box blocks the player if it cannot be pushed
- Player and box never overlap

This iteration is about **basic push interaction**, not delivery, scoring, or winning.
