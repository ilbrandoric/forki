# Iteration 04 — Collision Detection

## Goal

Detect collisions between the player and the obstacle.

At the end of this iteration:
- Player can collide with obstacle
- Collision is detected reliably
- Game reacts to collision (console log only)
- No game over screen yet

This iteration is about **detection**, not consequences.
