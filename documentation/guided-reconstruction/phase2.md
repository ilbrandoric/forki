# CONTEXT HANDOFF — Forki Learning Rebuild Project

## Project Summary
I am rebuilding the Forki forklift game **from scratch** as a learning exercise.

- The finished game already exists and is stored as reference
- I am rebuilding it step by step to deeply understand:
  - DOM manipulation
  - JavaScript architecture
  - Game loops
  - State → render flow
  - Positioning
  - Movement
  - Collisions
  - Game systems
- The rebuild is guided by ChatGPT acting as a **coding mentor**, not a code generator

This is a **reconstruction**, not a tutorial.
